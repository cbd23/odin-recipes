    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <h4>Step 1.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your vegetables.</li>
        <li>Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square.</li>
        <li>The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways.</li>
        <li>Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 2.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 3.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking: put your pan on the hob over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 4.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.</li>
        <li>Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 5.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown 500g lean minced beef.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 6.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits.</li>
        <li>Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 7.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water.</li>
        <li>Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 8.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Tip in ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Put in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 9.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Simmer it gently and bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 10.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn’t drying out.</li>
        <li>If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough.</li>
        <li>After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 11.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 12.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Taste a bit of the chilli and season.</li>
        <li>It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 13.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 14.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.</li>
    </ol>
